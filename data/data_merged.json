Even then, the leader had multiple options, including freeing them, ransoming them, or exchanging them. Those who became 'milk yamin' were not 'property' as understood in the West or the Bible. They were treated as brothers. Islam dictates they must be fed the same food you eat and clothed with the same clothes you wear. You cannot overwork them, and if you do, you must help them. If you beat them, they automatically go free. Regarding intercourse, this was a reality of war at that time. However, the woman was not property. If she did not want to have intercourse, she had the right to request 'mukata'—a contract to buy her own freedom. The owner is *forced* by Islamic law to grant this contract, and once requested, he cannot have intercourse with her. If she has a son, she also becomes free.

This is explicitly mentioned in the Hadith, where the Prophet stated that the life of a Muslim can only be taken for three reasons: murder (retribution), adultery in marriage, and the one who leaves his religion and the group of Muslims. However, this punishment (known as 'Hadd') is not applied by individuals; vigilantism is forbidden. It can only be carried out by a legitimate Shari'a state or government after a formal 'due process.' This is why, in most Muslim countries today, this law is not applied, as they do not fully implement the Shari'a. The wisdom behind this law, in the context of an Islamic state, is that when a person publicly leaves Islam, they don't just break the law themselves; they entice others to do so. This can create division and separation within society, as people start to subjectively reject God's laws—for example, regarding alcohol, interest (Riba), or fornication. This publicized rebellion can harm the faith of others and the harmony of the society. The punishment is primarily intended as a deterrent. It is crucial to understand that it only applies to someone who *publicly declares* their apostasy. If someone leaves Islam in their heart but keeps it to themselves, no one can know, and no punishment can be applied. The Prophet himself knew of hypocrites in his time but did not punish them because they did not openly declare their disbelief and create division. Furthermore, if someone does publicize it, they are not immediately punished. There is a process called 'seeking repentance,' where scholars will be brought to the person to discuss their doubts and provide rational responses. This can last for days or weeks. Only if the person arrogantly insists on publicizing their apostasy, fully knowing the law of the land, would the punishment be applied.

Modern science, through satellite imagery and fossil studies (like those in Nature Middle East and by NASA), confirms that Arabia had 10,000 ancient lakes and was once green, and it is currently undergoing a 'greening' process again. 3. **The Defeat of Empires:** He named specific countries Islam would spread to after his death (like Egypt, Turkey/Constantinople, Persia, India) and predicted the defeat of the two superpowers of the time, the Roman and Persian empires, which happened.",

Abu Bakr ordered the *collection* of all the scattered written parchments (which were on bones, rocks, etc.) into a single master copy. **Uthman's Role (3rd Caliph):** As Islam spread rapidly, different dialects and readings emerged. To prevent confusion, Uthman ordered *standardized copies* to be made from Abu Bakr's original master collection. He then sent these standardized copies to the different regions of the Muslim empire (like the Levant and Iraq) to ensure everyone had the same official text. Modern manuscripts, like the Birmingham and Topkapi manuscripts, date back to the first century (some to the Prophet's life) and are identical to the Quran we read today.",

As for Paradise, things there may share a name with things on Earth, but they are completely different. The Quran *explicitly* states that the wine in Paradise does **not** cause intoxication, loss of consciousness, or hangovers. It is a pure drink that is nothing like the harmful substance we have in this world. What is in Paradise is 'what no eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind can imagine.'",

Prophet Muhammad explicitly *forbade* severe hitting, hitting the face, breaking a bone, or leaving a mark. His cousin, Ibn Abbas, interpreting the verse, said this 'hitting' should be with a *siwak* (a small toothbrush-like stick) or a pen, to signify that this is the final stage before separation. 4. **Arbitration:** The very next verse (4:35) says if this fails, bring a judge from his family and her family to reconcile.

After he established a community in Medina, the Meccans gathered an army and *attacked* him in his new city. Over 90% of the battles the Prophet (pbuh) fought were self-defense. Later, when he returned to Mecca with an army of 10,000, the same people who had tortured and tried to kill him surrendered. He did not take revenge or murder them; he gathered them and said, 'You are free'.",

Uthman's relative, Mu'awiya, wanted immediate justice for the murder. Ali, however, had a different political vision, believing the community was too unstable and that seeking immediate justice would lead to more riots. This disagreement on *timing* led to a political split. The group that aligned with Ali eventually became known as Shia. The rest of the Muslims said 'we follow the Sunnah (the Prophet's way),' which is where the term Sunni comes from. Over time, the Shia branch developed new religious beliefs that are not in the Quran, such as the 12 infallible Imams or that Ali didn't die.",

It is a recommended (mustahabb) practice to breastfeed up to two years if the mother is able. The verse also allows earlier weaning; there is no sin if a mother stops before two years, provided the child’s nutritional needs are met. The reference to \"30 months\" is not found in the Quran; it may be a misunderstanding of other scholarly opinions, but the clear Qur'anic limit is two years. Therefore, breastfeeding for up to two years is encouraged, not mandatory, and stopping earlier is permissible.\nFor example, a mother who weans at 18 months is still acting within Islamic guidance, as the Quran permits flexibility based on the mother’s circumstances.",

For example, the story of Prophet Yusuf shows how patience and trust in Allah lead to eventual triumph, even after severe trials.

The Qur'an narrates that the brothers plotted, saying, \"We will kill him, or cast him out to some distant land\" (Surah Yusuf 12:8). They chose the latter, casting him into a well, hoping he would die or be lost. This act was a test for both Yusuf and his brothers. Allah later says, \"And We caused Yusuf to be saved from the well\" (12:24), showing that the trial was part of a divine plan to bring about Yusuf’s eventual rise to power and the eventual reconciliation of the family.

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) reinforced this by saying, \"The strong person is not the one who overpowers others, but the one who controls his anger\" (Sahih Bukhari). Yusuf’s example encourages Muslims to respond to injustice with forgiveness, trusting that Allah will reward the righteous and rectify the situation in the Hereafter.",

A valid nikah requires the consent of both parties, the presence of a wali (guardian) for the bride, at least two adult Muslim witnesses, and a mahr (gift) from the groom to the bride. The contract is independent of any civil law; the state may register the marriage for legal purposes, but the religious obligations remain the same. For example, a Muslim couple can perform nikah in a mosque with the required witnesses and later register the marriage with the civil authorities to obtain legal recognition. This shows that the religious ceremony fulfills the Islamic requirement, while civil registration satisfies the state’s requirement.",

Islamic jurisprudence (Sharia) provides detailed rules for these issues, and any civil law that contradicts clear Qur'anic injunctions or authentic hadith is not binding on Muslims. For instance, while the UCC may prescribe a uniform age for marriage, Islam permits marriage at puberty with guardian consent, and scholars consider the Qur'anic principle of protecting the welfare of the family (maslahah) as paramount.

The UCC does not add new rights beyond what Sharia provides; it merely standardizes civil procedures. For example, a woman can request khulʿ by returning the mahr to the husband, and a court can grant a judicial divorce if she proves harm or neglect, as established in the hadith: “If a woman fears ill‑treatment, she should seek a divorce” (Sahih Bukhari).

Since understanding a creator involves recognizing purpose, moral responsibility, and spiritual dimensions—areas beyond mere data processing—the robot’s comprehension will always be partial and contingent on the completeness of the information it receives.",

The Qur’an says, “When the soul reaches the collarbone, and the death has been sent (to the grave), then indeed, the grave is a barrier until the Day they are raised” (Qur’an 23:99‑100). Authentic hadiths in Sahih Bukhari and Muslim describe the angels asking the deceased, “Who is your Lord? What is your religion? Who is this man who was sent among you?” The answers determine whether the person experiences comfort (a garden of the grave) or torment (a fire of the grave). Thus, ajabe kabar is not a physical place but a spiritual state that precedes the final judgment, serving as a test of one’s faith before the ultimate accounting on the Day of Judgment.",

    "output": "The physical condition of the body after death does not affect the soul’s accountability. Islam teaches that the soul is separated from the body at death and is immediately subject to the questioning in the grave, regardless of whether the corpse is buried, burned, or consumed. The Qur’an states, “Every soul will taste death, and you will only be given your [full] recompense on the Day of Resurrection” (Qur’an 3:185). A hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah reports that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “When a person dies, his deeds end except for three: ongoing charity, beneficial knowledge, and a righteous child who prays for him.” This indicates that the soul’s reward is based on deeds, not the state of the body. For example, a martyr whose body was burned in battle still receives the promised reward of Paradise because his intention and sacrifice were accepted by Allah. Therefore, whether the body is buried, burned, or eaten, the soul will still receive its due reward or punishment based on its deeds.",

A hadith in Sahih Muslim explains that on the Day of Judgment, the angels will say, “All creatures will be gathered, but only the humans will be judged.” Since animals lack the capacity for belief (iman) and sin (shirk), they are not subject to the afterlife’s accountability.

The Qur’an balances these attributes: “My mercy encompasses all things, but I will not let the believers be punished beyond what they deserve” (Qur’an 7:156). The grave’s punishment is a manifestation of divine justice for those who reject guidance, while mercy is shown to those who repent and believe. A hadith states, “Allah’s mercy prevails over His wrath, but He does not punish a servant beyond his deeds.” Thus, the existence of punishment in the grave reflects the fair recompense for one’s actions, while Allah’s mercy remains available for those who turn to Him.

The scholar cites a hadith where the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “The heart of a believer is a lantern, but the heart of a disbeliever is a darkness.” Thus, intellect can lead one to accept revelation, but the detailed knowledge of the afterlife comes from the Qur’an and Sunnah, not solely from personal reasoning.",

Another verse, “And the earth will be a wide expanse, and the heavens will be a canopy” (Qur’an 78:6‑7), implies a separation of realms.

The Qur'an commands, “Worship only Allah and associate nothing with Him” (Surah An‑Nisa 4:36). 3) **Tawhid al‑Asma wa‑Sifat** – affirmation of Allah’s names and attributes as described in the Qur'an and authentic hadith, without likening them to creation.

Animals act according to their nature and do not claim divinity; they are created to serve a purpose.

A hadith narrated by Al‑Bukhari states that a Muslim who possesses these traits will find protection from both worldly and spiritual harm.

The Caliph, as the leader of the Muslim community, must meet several criteria: he must be a Muslim of sound belief, possess good moral character, have the ability to administer justice, and be chosen by the consensus (ijma) of the believers. Historically, four main methods have been recorded. First, Abu Bakr was selected by the companions in Medina after the Prophet’s death through a public consultation. Second, Umar was nominated by Abu Bakr during his lifetime and confirmed by the community. Third, a council (shura) was formed to elect the next leader, as happened when Umar appointed a group of senior companions to choose the successor, leading to the selection of Uthman. Fourth, the community of qualified scholars and elders (the Ahl al‑Sunnah) could collectively appoint a leader, a method used in later periods. All these methods share the principle that the leader must be chosen by the people who are knowledgeable about the Qur'an and Sunnah, ensuring that the government remains a true implementation of Islamic law.",

Third, the moral argument notes an innate sense of right and wrong in humans, which presupposes a Moral Lawgiver; the Qur'an affirms this by saying, \"We have sent down to you the Book as a guidance\" (17:9).

A perpetrator may seek sincere repentance, which requires immediate remorse, cessation of the sin, restitution to the victim, and a firm intention not to repeat the act. However, repentance does not erase the victim’s right to justice. Allah says, “Indeed, Allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice” (4:58). The victim’s rights are protected by both divine law and, where applicable, worldly legal systems. Allah’s ultimate justice will be rendered on the Day of Judgment, where every injustice will be accounted for, and the victim will receive recompense. The rapist’s fate depends on the sincerity of his repentance and the fulfillment of all conditions, including compensation to the victim.",

By attributing divine qualities to anyone or anything besides Allah, a person denies the very foundation of worship and obedience. This sin nullifies all other good deeds, as the intention behind worship becomes corrupted.

The term “yawm” elsewhere refers to a month, a year, or an era (e.g., Surah Al-Hajj 22:47: “And they urge you to hasten the punishment, but Allah does not fail in His promise”). Scholars explain that the six “days” may represent six distinct phases of creation, each of unknown length, compatible with scientific findings that the universe formed over billions of years. The Qur'an also states, “He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth in six signs” (Surah Yunus 10:3), emphasizing the orderly process rather than a literal day count.

Another verse declares, “And there is no creature on earth but that upon Allah is its sustenance, and He knows its place of dwelling and place of storage. All is in a clear register” (Surah Hud 11:6). The Prophet ﷺ taught that the heart that contemplates the order, beauty, and purpose of creation will come to know its Creator.

For example, when a Christian monk visited him, the Prophet answered his questions patiently and invited him to pray, saying, \"If you love Allah, you will love His messenger\" (Bukhari).

For example, when a person prays, works, or helps a neighbor, if he says, \"I do this for Allah,\" his deed is accepted as an act of worship. When death comes, the believer trusts that his soul returns to Allah as a trust (amanah) that was given to him in this life, and his death becomes a completion of that trust, not a loss.

The main concern is whether the cryptocurrency functions as a stable, recognized medium of exchange or as a speculative asset with excessive uncertainty (gharar). If it is used merely as a means of payment that is widely accepted and its value is not based on gambling or fraud, many scholars consider it permissible. However, if the transaction involves high volatility, speculation, or the creation of new coins without a tangible asset backing, it may be deemed impermissible. The Quran warns against gambling and uncertainty: \"O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, but fear Allah that you may be successful\" (Quran 2:275). Because Bitcoin lacks a central authority and its price can swing dramatically, some scholars advise caution and recommend avoiding it until clearer guidance is issued. If a country has declared Bitcoin legal and regulated, investing may be allowed provided the transaction does not involve prohibited activities such as fraud, money‑laundering, or interest. For example, a Muslim living in a jurisdiction where Bitcoin is recognized as a legitimate asset can invest a modest amount after ensuring the transaction is transparent and free from riba.

Slaves are referred to as \"those whom your right hands possess\" and are granted several rights: they must be fed, clothed, and not overburdened (Quran 24:33). The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"Your slaves are your brothers; feed them from what you eat and clothe them from what you wear\" (Sahih Bukhari). Emancipation is highly rewarded; freeing a slave is considered an act of charity (Sahih Muslim). For example, a slave who works honestly may be granted freedom as a reward for good deeds, and the owner is encouraged to set a contract for emancipation.

Therefore, any loan that involves a predetermined extra amount based on time is haram, whether it is for buying a car, paying tuition, or personal expenses. Islamic alternatives such as profit‑and‑loss sharing (mudarabah) or interest‑free financing (murabaha) are recommended. For example, a Muslim can purchase a car through a murabaha contract where the bank buys the car and sells it to the buyer at a higher price payable in installments, without charging interest.

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) established a state in Medina to apply Islamic principles, yet the primary purpose was to create a just society, not to create a political empire. Scholars agree that the focus should be on personal piety, social justice, and serving humanity, while political structures may vary according to context.

If a vaccine contains haram ingredients such as pork gelatin, scholars apply the principle of necessity (darura) and allow its use when no halal alternative exists and the vaccine is essential for health. In such cases, the haram component is considered nullified by the greater good. For example, a Muslim child receiving a measles vaccine that contains a minimal amount of gelatin is permitted because the vaccine prevents a serious disease and no halal substitute is available.

When a new issue arises, scholars examine the primary texts, the purposes of the law (preserving life, intellect, religion, lineage, and property), and the current context to issue a ruling. For example, the issue of digital currencies was not present in early texts, so scholars analyze the principles of money, prohibition of riba, and avoidance of gharar to determine permissibility.

Non‑Muslim employees are also entitled to safety, reasonable working hours, and respect for their religious practices.

Permanent tattoos create a lasting mark that cannot be removed, which is why they are prohibited. In contrast, hair coloring is permissible because it is a temporary change that does not permanently alter the body and is often done for cleanliness or aesthetic reasons. The scholars cite the hadith that permits the use of henna for beautification, stating that it does not constitute changing Allah's creation.

A person who expresses doubt but still affirms the oneness of Allah and the prophethood of Muhammad remains a Muslim. Only when a person denies the reality of divine decree or attributes ultimate control to other than Allah does disbelief occur.

The prohibition is based on hadiths that forbid drawing the Prophet to safeguard his unique status. For example, early Islamic scholars cited the saying, \"Whoever makes a picture of a living being will be punished on the Day of Judgment\" (Sahih Bukhari). Therefore, while the Bible may have illustrations of earlier figures, Islam refrains from visual representation of the Prophet, focusing instead on textual reverence.

Parents, spouses, and grandparents also have prescribed portions. For example, a husband receives half of his deceased wife's estate if she has no children, while a wife receives one-fourth of her husband's estate if he has no children. The remaining shares are distributed among children, parents, and sometimes siblings, following the hierarchy outlined in Surah An-Nisa.

After the Prophet's death, the companions compiled the Qur'an into a single written codex under Caliph Abu Bakr and later standardized it under Caliph Uthman. The written text was distributed to all major Islamic centers, while the oral tradition continued uninterrupted. For example, the famous Hafs and Warsh recitations are based on chains of transmission that trace back to the Prophet.

A well‑known hadith recorded in Sahih Bukhari states, \"Whoever insults a Prophet, kill him.\" This indicates that, in classical Islamic law, the crime carries a capital penalty. However, the implementation of this punishment depends on the authority of an Islamic state; the Qur'an also emphasizes that judgment belongs to Allah (Surah Al-An'am 6:164).

However, malicious criticism that amounts to slander or blasphemy is prohibited. The Qur'an warns, \"And do not insult those they worship besides Allah\" (Surah Al-An'am 6:108). A hadith recorded in Sunan Abu Dawood states, \"Whoever insults a Prophet, kill him,\" indicating that intentional, contemptuous criticism of the Prophet is a punishable offense. Therefore, constructive dialogue is allowed, but contemptuous or hateful criticism that harms the honor of Allah or the Prophet is subject to legal penalties under Islamic law.",

He also referenced a hadith in which the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, “Whatever intoxicates in large quantities, a small amount of it is also forbidden.” The scholar noted that modern attempts to ban alcohol through state policies often fail because the underlying purpose is to protect health and prevent social harm, which aligns with the Qur'anic intent.

When a new issue arises that is not mentioned explicitly, scholars use analogy (qiyas) and public interest (maslahah) to derive a ruling. However, they cannot label something haram solely based on personal opinion; they must demonstrate that the practice contradicts a known principle or leads to harm.

There is no cycle of rebirth; each person has only one life, one death, and then judgment. The concept of karma, where deeds in one life affect the next, is replaced by the Islamic principle that all deeds are judged on the Day of Judgment. A hadith in Sahih Muslim explains that a person’s record of deeds is presented to Allah, and he will be rewarded or punished accordingly. For example, a good deed done now will be rewarded in the Hereafter, not in a future earthly life.",

For example, giving money to the poor with the sincere hope of helping them and seeking Allah’s reward is far more valuable than giving the same amount to gain social status.

This allowed companions from different Arab tribes to understand the Qur'an in their native linguistic styles. The seven Ahruf were later unified into the ten recognized qira'at to preserve the text while accommodating these variations. For example, the word \"malik\" (king) can be read as \"malik\" or \"malik\" depending on the Ahruf, yet the meaning remains the same.

A translation is essential for non‑Arabic speakers to grasp the message, but it should complement, not replace, the Arabic recitation.

In Arabic, the word \"fatwa\" (فَتْوَى) and its synonym \"sutiyah\" (سُتْيَة) both denote the act of providing a legal ruling or clarification. The definition is that a qualified scholar, after examining the relevant Quranic verses, prophetic traditions (hadith), and established jurisprudence, gives a response that guides the questioner on what is permissible (halal) or prohibited (haram). For example, when the Pharaoh of Egypt asked his officials to interpret his dream, the Prophet Yusuf (Joseph) provided a divine explanation, which is an early illustration of giving a religious answer to a query.

For instance, when a companion broke a treaty, the Prophet reminded him of his oath, offered forgiveness upon sincere repentance, and restored the agreement. This shows that the Prophet combined firm guidance with mercy, aiming to reform rather than punish.",

The Qur'an mentions that the living can ask for forgiveness for the dead: \"And those who, when they die, say, ‘Our Lord, forgive us and our living and our dead’\" (2:156). The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"Make du'a for the dead, for they cannot ask for forgiveness themselves\" (Sahih Bukhari). While sincere personal repentance is the best means of attaining forgiveness, Allah’s mercy can also be invoked through the prayers of the living. For example, a person who died in a state of minor sin can have his sins reduced if his family continuously makes du'a and gives charity on his behalf. This shows that du'a is a powerful tool for seeking Allah’s mercy for the deceased.",

The Qur'an states, \"And those who, when they commit an immorality or wrong, remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins\" (3:135). The Prophet (peace be upon him) added that repentance must be accompanied by making amends if the sin involved the rights of others. For example, if a person stole, true repentance includes returning the stolen property or compensating the victim. Allah promises to accept sincere repentance: \"Say, ‘O My servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of Allah’s mercy. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins’\" (39:53). This shows that when a person genuinely regrets, stops the sin, and resolves not to repeat it, Allah’s mercy can erase the sin.",

A hadith narrated by Abu Hurairah states, “Whoever makes an image of a living being will be punished on the Day of Resurrection.” This hadith warns against creating or venerating images, not against merely looking at them. Therefore, using a donkey’s picture does not amount to shirk (associating partners with Allah), but it also does not fulfill the spiritual goal of self‑remembrance.

The Qur'an also reminds us that life is a trial: \"And We will surely test you with something of fear and hunger\" (Qur'an 2:155). A hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah says, \"The strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than the weak believer, while there is good in both\" (Sahih Muslim). This encourages believers to work for provision, help the needy, and trust that ultimate reward lies with Allah in the Hereafter.

It means that the unity of belief is not imposed; rather, people are given different backgrounds, languages, and circumstances to see who will choose the right path. The Qur'an explains, \"And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the diversity of your languages and colors\" (Qur'an 30:22). This diversity serves as a trial, allowing individuals to seek the truth. The Prophet said, \"The best of people are those who bring the most benefit to others\" (Sahih Bukhari), indicating that true unity is achieved through righteous conduct, not uniformity of belief imposed by force.",

Hard work is a means of seeking Allah’s provision. When a farmer’s crops fail, it may be due to natural causes, a test, or a reminder to rely on Allah and seek help from the community. The Prophet taught, \"The best of deeds is to feed the hungry\" (Sahih Bukhari), encouraging believers to support those in need.

His livelihood came from the modest earnings of his family members and the support of the Muslim community.

His diet consisted mainly of water, dates, barley bread, and occasional meat, reflecting the simple lifestyle of the early Muslim community. He never accumulated personal wealth; any gifts he received were distributed among the needy, exemplifying the Qur’anic principle that true wealth is in piety, not material possessions (Qur’an 2:177).",

The Prophet’s simple lifestyle demonstrated reliance on Allah (tawakkul) and prevented any suspicion that his message was motivated by material gain. A well‑known hadith records that he said, “The best of people are those who are most beneficial to others, and the best of deeds is feeding the poor” (Sahih Muslim, 2588).

Authentic scholars apply strict criteria: an unbroken chain of trustworthy narrators (isnad), consistency with the Qur’an, and conformity with stronger hadith. When a narration fails these tests, it is classified as fabricated (mawdu‘) or weak. The Qur’an warns against following falsehood: “And do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge” (Qur’an 17:36). Some Muslims, lacking proper training, may accept weak reports out of reverence for tradition or because they are presented without scholarly verification. Others, aware of the science of hadith criticism, reject such reports to preserve the purity of the prophetic message. An example is the practice of “tawassul” (seeking intercession) through certain weak narrations; scholars who prioritize authentic sources advise abandoning it, while those who rely on popular tradition may continue it.

The science of hadith criticism (‘Ilm al‑Hadith) has been practiced since the early generations of Muslims. Scholars such as Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim applied stringent criteria to compile only authentic (sahih) reports, deliberately excluding fabricated ones. The Qur’an supports this corrective process: “And if you disagree about any matter, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if you should be believers” (Qur’an 4:59). When a narration is proven fabricated, it is omitted from the authoritative collections, and later scholars publish revised editions that mark or exclude such reports.

They can point out that Dawkins’ arguments are based on a materialist framework that does not consider the metaphysical dimensions addressed by the Qur’an and prophetic teachings. Additionally, Muslims can cite scientific verses in the Qur’an that align with modern discoveries (e.g., the development of the embryo in Qur’an 23:12‑14) as evidence that the divine text engages with reality, contrary to Dawkins’ claim that religion is purely myth.",

Next, authentic (sahih) hadith outrank weak (da‘if) or fabricated (mawdu‘) reports. Scholars examine the chain of narrators (isnad) for reliability, the continuity of transmission, and the content (matn) for consistency with established principles. When two authentic reports appear to conflict, scholars employ the principle of “abrogation” (naskh) if one was revealed later, or they interpret them in a complementary manner, considering context (asbâb al‑wuqu‘). For example, the Qur’an permits the consumption of fish (Qur’an 5:96) while a weak hadith suggests otherwise; the Qur’an’s clear ruling prevails.

Reason is considered a tool to understand the signs of Allah and to verify the truth of revelation. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “The ink of the scholar is more sacred than the blood of the martyr” (Sahih Bukhari, 9:88), highlighting the value of knowledge and rational inquiry.

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) instructed Muslims to pray the special eclipse prayer (Salat al-Kusuf) during such events, emphasizing humility before Allah. For example, just as a sudden darkness prompts people to seek shelter, the eclipse prompts believers to turn to Allah in prayer and reflection, reinforcing faith.",

The inimitability (i'jaz) of the Qur'an demonstrates that it could not have been produced by humans. Additionally, the consistency of its message over 23 years, its preservation, and its profound impact on individuals serve as evidence.

The objection also stems from the belief that the Qur'an and Hadith have been distorted or misinterpreted, leading to the idea that Islam endorses cruelty. In reality, the punishments are meant as deterrents and are prescribed only when very specific criteria are met, such as the value of stolen property, the presence of reliable witnesses, and the offender’s intent. The Qur'an states, “The hand of the thief should be cut off as a deterrent” (Qur'an 5:38), and the Prophet Muhammad emphasized that hadd punishments are a mercy to society because they prevent greater harm.

If the person continues to insult, the recommended approach is to withdraw until the agitation subsides, as the scholar explained that engaging while emotions run high often leads to further provocation.

The Qur'an states, \"And it is He who has made you successors upon the earth and has raised some of you above others in degrees [of rank] that He may try you through what He has given you\" (Surah Al-An'am 6:165). This means that the amount of wealth a person receives is a means to test gratitude, generosity, and reliance on Allah. For example, a rich person may be tested by how much he shares with the poor, while a poor person may be tested by his patience and trust in Allah's provision. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"The wealth of a person is a trust; if he spends it in the way of Allah, it will increase for him, and if he hoards it, it will decrease\" (Hadith reported by Al-Bukhari). Therefore, wealth is a trial that must be handled with humility and responsibility.",

This verse warns against fraud, bribery, and any form of exploitation. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, \"Whoever cheats is not one of us\" (Sahih Muslim).

The Prophet (peace be upon him) explained that the punishment is meant as a deterrent, not as a means of cruelty, and that mercy should be shown when the thief repents. For example, a thief who steals a small amount of food to feed a starving family may be given a chance to repent and compensate, illustrating that the law balances justice with compassion.",

For example, when a public official tried to bribe a merchant, the merchant refused and reported the incident to the authorities, showing integrity.

This verse places love for humanity and for those in need above any tribal or national loyalty. A hadith states, “A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim; he does not wrong him nor does he abandon him.” (Sahih Bukhari).

Since the phrase elevates the nation to a divine status, it amounts to shirk (associating partners with Allah). Therefore, a Muslim should refrain from reciting or singing such slogans.

This establishes the principle of covering, but the exact form (hijab, niqab, burqa) is a matter of scholarly interpretation and cultural context. If a country legally prohibits the burqa, a Muslim woman must obey the law unless it forces her to abandon modesty entirely. In such cases, scholars advise wearing the most modest permissible attire (e.g., a loose hijab and long coat) that complies with the law while maintaining Islamic modesty. For example, a woman in France may wear a long, loose dress and a headscarf, fulfilling the Qur'anic requirement without violating the ban.

The fitrah provides the potential to recognize truth, but external factors such as family upbringing, culture, education, and societal pressure shape a person's beliefs. When a child grows up in an environment that teaches a different creed, the initial inclination can be overridden by learned habits and convictions.

    "input": "",
    "output": "In John 14:16‑17 the term “Comforter” (Greek: Parakletos) is used. Muslim scholars interpret this as a reference to the Qur'an and the final messenger, Muhammad, who would bring the ultimate guidance after Jesus. The Qur'an itself says in Surah Al‑Maidah (5:46) that Jesus was sent with “the revelation (Injil) and a spirit from Allah.” The “spirit” is understood to be the divine message that would later be completed in the Qur'an. Therefore, the Comforter is not a separate divine entity but a promise of continued guidance, fulfilled by the Qur'an and the Prophet Muhammad, ensuring that the message of monotheism remains unbroken.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Islam holds that ultimate knowledge about the purpose of existence, the unseen (ghayb), and the criteria for judgment belongs solely to Allah. The Qur'an states in Surah Al‑Ankabut (29:56), “And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.” Knowledge that leads to worship must therefore come from the Creator. While reason is a valuable tool, it is limited, as illustrated by the earlier supercomputer analogy. Revelation (the Qur'an) provides the definitive answers that human intellect cannot deduce on its own, such as the reality of the afterlife, the nature of divine justice, and the specifics of worship. Hence, Muslims are encouraged to use reason within the framework of revelation, ensuring that conclusions align with divine guidance.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Investing in the stock market is permissible provided the following conditions are met: the company’s business must be halal (e.g., technology, manufacturing) and its earnings must come from permissible sources; the investor must not engage in speculative day‑trading that resembles gambling; and the transaction must be a genuine sale with ownership transferred to the buyer. The Qur’an warns against gambling and excessive uncertainty: “O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, but fear Allah that you may be successful” (Qur’an 2:275). Day‑trading, where the trader does not actually own the shares for a meaningful period, is likened to gambling and is therefore discouraged. For example, buying shares of a tech company like Apple, holding them for a reasonable time, and earning dividends from its lawful profits is allowed, whereas repeatedly buying and selling a stock within minutes to chase price fluctuations is not.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Most scholars consider cryptocurrency not to be a valid currency because it lacks intrinsic value, central regulation, and widespread acceptance as a medium of exchange. It is often treated like a speculative asset, and many compare it to gambling, which is prohibited: “O you who have believed, do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse, and do not kill yourselves” (Qur’an 4:29) – the principle extends to any activity that involves undue risk and chance. Consequently, investing in cryptocurrency is generally deemed impermissible (haram) unless a future consensus among qualified scholars declares it halal. Even if some view it as a currency, the high volatility and the possibility of fraud make it akin to gambling, which the Prophet ﷺ said is “the mother of all evils.”",

A lawyer must avoid defending injustice; a doctor must preserve life and not perform prohibited procedures; an engineer must ensure that his projects do not facilitate oppression or haram activities. Honesty, avoiding deceit, and upholding justice are the core criteria. The Qur’an reinforces this: “Indeed, Allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice” (Qur’an 4:58).",
