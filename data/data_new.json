Badr was fought to protect the Muslims from the Quraysh’s planned attack, making it a legitimate defensive struggle.

The angels acted as a hidden force that bolstered the believers’ morale and weakened the enemy, while the Muslims engaged with swords and bows.

The Qur'an condemns their actions as a form of shirk (associating partners with Allah) and describes their punishment as a warning for all societies. Muslims should publicly denounce such behavior, refuse to normalize it, and oppose any attempts to force it on the community. This includes speaking out against the symbols, refusing to teach it in schools, and encouraging families to teach the story of Lut and the Qur'anic moral lessons to children.

The story of Lut illustrates a pattern of extreme immorality, public indecency, and the refusal to accept divine guidance.

Scientific studies cited by mainstream researchers have not identified a single \"gay gene\" that determines sexual orientation; instead, they point to complex environmental and psychological factors. While some animal species display same‑sex behavior, this does not equate to a natural, permanent orientation in humans.

The verse also allows earlier weaning; there is no sin if a mother stops before two years, provided the child’s nutritional needs are met. The reference to \"30 months\" is not found in the Quran; it may be a misunderstanding of other scholarly opinions, but the clear Qur'anic limit is two years. Therefore, breastfeeding for up to two years is encouraged, not mandatory, and stopping earlier is permissible.\nFor example, a mother who weans at 18 months is still acting within Islamic guidance, as the Quran permits flexibility based on the mother’s circumstances.",

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) reinforced this by saying, \"The strong person is not the one who overpowers others, but the one who controls his anger\" (Sahih Bukhari).

The Qur'an says, “And among His signs is that He created for you mates from among yourselves that you may find tranquility in them” (Qur'an 30:21). A valid nikah requires the consent of both parties, the presence of a wali (guardian) for the bride, at least two adult Muslim witnesses, and a mahr (gift) from the groom to the bride. The contract is independent of any civil law; the state may register the marriage for legal purposes, but the religious obligations remain the same. For example, a Muslim couple can perform nikah in a mosque with the required witnesses and later register the marriage with the civil authorities to obtain legal recognition. This shows that the religious ceremony fulfills the Islamic requirement, while civil registration satisfies the state’s requirement.",

The Qur'an states, “There is no compulsion in religion” (Qur'an 2:256), meaning each community retains its own legal system for matters of family, inheritance, and marriage. Islamic jurisprudence (Sharia) provides detailed rules for these issues, and any civil law that contradicts clear Qur'anic injunctions or authentic hadith is not binding on Muslims. For instance, while the UCC may prescribe a uniform age for marriage, Islam permits marriage at puberty with guardian consent, and scholars consider the Qur'anic principle of protecting the welfare of the family (maslahah) as paramount. Therefore, the UCC cannot be imposed on Muslims where it conflicts with Sharia.",

The UCC does not add new rights beyond what Sharia provides; it merely standardizes civil procedures. For example, a woman can request khulʿ by returning the mahr to the husband, and a court can grant a judicial divorce if she proves harm or neglect, as established in the hadith: “If a woman fears ill‑treatment, she should seek a divorce” (Sahih Bukhari).

The Qur’an states, “Every soul will taste death, and you will only be given your [full] recompense on the Day of Resurrection” (Qur’an 3:185). A hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah reports that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “When a person dies, his deeds end except for three: ongoing charity, beneficial knowledge, and a righteous child who prays for him.” This indicates that the soul’s reward is based on deeds, not the state of the body.

A hadith in Sahih Muslim explains that on the Day of Judgment, the angels will say, “All creatures will be gathered, but only the humans will be judged.” Since animals lack the capacity for belief (iman) and sin (shirk), they are not subject to the afterlife’s accountability.

The grave’s punishment is a manifestation of divine justice for those who reject guidance, while mercy is shown to those who repent and believe.

For example, the institution of zakat (obligatory charity) ensures wealth redistribution, reducing poverty and fostering community solidarity. These teachings together create a balanced life that prepares a person for both this world (dunya) and the hereafter (akhirah).",

    "output": "Rabbani Niyyah means directing one’s intention solely toward Allah, the Lord (Rabb). It is the purpose behind every act of worship and daily activity, so that the deed is performed for God alone and not for worldly gain. The Qur'an says, “And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me” (Surah Dhariyat 51:56). When a person prays, eats, or works with the intention of pleasing Allah, the act becomes a means of drawing closer to Him. For example, saying “Bismillah” before a meal acknowledges that the sustenance is a blessing from Allah, and thanking Him after eating (Al‑hamdulillah) reinforces the Rabbani intention. This focus transforms ordinary actions into acts of worship, leading the believer toward becoming a true servant of the Lord.",

The Qur'an affirms, “He is Allah, the Creator, the One who gives life and causes death” (Surah Al‑Mulk 67:2). 2) **Tawhid al‑Uluhiyyah** – worship is due only to Allah; no other being or object may be worshipped. The Qur'an commands, “Worship only Allah and associate nothing with Him” (Surah An‑Nisa 4:36). 3) **Tawhid al‑Asma wa‑Sifat** – affirmation of Allah’s names and attributes as described in the Qur'an and authentic hadith, without likening them to creation. For example, Allah is Al‑Alim (All‑Knowing) and Al‑Qadir (All‑Powerful); these attributes belong exclusively to Him. Together these three forms create a crystal‑clear concept of monotheism that is free from any error or compromise.",

Animals act according to their nature and do not claim divinity; they are created to serve a purpose. When a human claims partnership with Allah, he elevates his own status above the Creator, violating the logical order established by Allah. This is why the Qur'an describes such people as “worse than animals” (Surah Al‑Maidah 5:60).

    "output": "Allah’s guidance does not intend to cause depression; rather, He allows trials to awaken the heart. The Qur'an states, “And it is He who has made you successors upon the earth and has raised some of you above others in degrees that He may try you through what He has given you” (Surah Al‑Anfal 8:28). When a person abandons the deen, the resulting hardships are a sign (a “signal”) to return, not a punishment for the sake of suffering. The Prophet (peace be upon Allah) said, “When a servant turns away from the path, Allah may loosen his rope as a warning, and if he repents, the rope is tightened again.” For example, a believer who neglected prayer began to experience anxiety and loss of peace; after sincere repentance, his heart was healed and his life became tranquil. This demonstrates that the purpose of the difficulty is to guide, not to inflict lasting depression.",

All other sins, whether major or minor, can be erased through sincere repentance (taubah). The Prophet (peace be upon Allah) said, “Allah is more merciful to His servants than a mother is to her child.” For example, a person who committed theft and later sincerely repented was forgiven, as recorded in many hadiths.

Islam fills that gap by stating that Allah created the universe with purpose, and the \"why\" belongs to divine wisdom.",

Historically, four main methods have been recorded. First, Abu Bakr was selected by the companions in Medina after the Prophet’s death through a public consultation. Second, Umar was nominated by Abu Bakr during his lifetime and confirmed by the community. Third, a council (shura) was formed to elect the next leader, as happened when Umar appointed a group of senior companions to choose the successor, leading to the selection of Uthman. Fourth, the community of qualified scholars and elders (the Ahl al‑Sunnah) could collectively appoint a leader, a method used in later periods.

Third, the moral argument notes an innate sense of right and wrong in humans, which presupposes a Moral Lawgiver; the Qur'an affirms this by saying, \"We have sent down to you the Book as a guidance\" (17:9).

The Qur'an describes the Hereafter in many verses, for example, “Every soul will taste death, then to Us you will be returned” (21:35) and “Indeed, the righteous will be in gardens and rivers” (55:46‑47). These statements are matters of faith (iman) rather than empirical observation. While scientific discoveries can inspire reflection on the signs of God’s creation, they do not constitute proof of Paradise or Hell. The Qur'an encourages believers to contemplate the signs (ayat) in nature (e.g., 51:20‑21) and to trust the revelation for matters beyond physical measurement. Hence, the existence of the afterlife remains a theological truth affirmed by revelation, not a scientific hypothesis.",

The Qur'an says, “And they do not contemplate the Qur'an, lest they should be guided by it, or that they might be reminded” (16:78), urging reflection rather than proof. Scholars have historically employed astronomy, medicine, and mathematics to appreciate God’s signs, yet they maintain that belief rests on divine revelation. Using science to support a belief is permissible when the evidence aligns with the Qur'an, but rejecting a belief because science has not yet explained it is not allowed. The proper approach is to hold faith while seeking knowledge, recognizing that some truths (e.g., the existence of God, the Day of Judgment) are beyond the scope of empirical methods.",

However, accountability in the Hereafter differs: humans are judged for moral choices, while animals are not held responsible for sin.

The Qur'an frequently addresses the nafs, urging believers to purify it: “Indeed, the soul (nafs) is a persistent enjoiner of evil” (12:53).

However, repentance does not erase the victim’s right to justice. Allah says, “Indeed, Allah commands you to render trusts to whom they are due and when you judge between people to judge with justice” (4:58). The victim’s rights are protected by both divine law and, where applicable, worldly legal systems.

By attributing divine qualities to anyone or anything besides Allah, a person denies the very foundation of worship and obedience.

The term “yawm” elsewhere refers to a month, a year, or an era (e.g., Surah Al-Hajj 22:47: “And they urge you to hasten the punishment, but Allah does not fail in His promise”). Scholars explain that the six “days” may represent six distinct phases of creation, each of unknown length, compatible with scientific findings that the universe formed over billions of years. The Qur'an also states, “He is the One Who created the heavens and the earth in six signs” (Surah Yunus 10:3), emphasizing the orderly process rather than a literal day count.

Tawhid shapes a Muslim’s worldview, ensuring that all worship, gratitude, and reliance are directed solely to Allah.

If it is used merely as a means of payment that is widely accepted and its value is not based on gambling or fraud, many scholars consider it permissible. However, if the transaction involves high volatility, speculation, or the creation of new coins without a tangible asset backing, it may be deemed impermissible. The Quran warns against gambling and uncertainty: \"O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, but fear Allah that you may be successful\" (Quran 2:275). Because Bitcoin lacks a central authority and its price can swing dramatically, some scholars advise caution and recommend avoiding it until clearer guidance is issued. If a country has declared Bitcoin legal and regulated, investing may be allowed provided the transaction does not involve prohibited activities such as fraud, money‑laundering, or interest. For example, a Muslim living in a jurisdiction where Bitcoin is recognized as a legitimate asset can invest a modest amount after ensuring the transaction is transparent and free from riba.

In such cases, the haram component is considered nullified by the greater good.

The Qur'an commands, \"There is no compulsion in religion\" (Quran 2:256) and encourages the use of reason and consultation (shura). When a new issue arises, scholars examine the primary texts, the purposes of the law (preserving life, intellect, religion, lineage, and property), and the current context to issue a ruling. For example, the issue of digital currencies was not present in early texts, so scholars analyze the principles of money, prohibition of riba, and avoidance of gharar to determine permissibility. This shows that while the Qur'an and Sunnah are the ultimate sources, applying them wisely to contemporary matters requires ijtihad (independent reasoning) within the framework of Islamic principles.",

The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, \"Give the worker his wages before his sweat dries\" (Sahih Bukhari), indicating prompt and fair payment regardless of the worker's faith. Non‑Muslim employees are also entitled to safety, reasonable working hours, and respect for their religious practices. For example, a Muslim factory owner in a mixed‑faith community provides a prayer space for Muslim workers and a separate area for non‑Muslim workers to observe their own rituals, ensuring both groups can practice their faiths without hindrance.

Voting for a candidate who upholds justice, protects the rights of minorities, and does not enact laws contrary to Sharia is permissible. If all options conflict with Islamic values, a Muslim should abstain or seek the lesser evil.

Permanent tattoos create a lasting mark that cannot be removed, which is why they are prohibited. In contrast, hair coloring is permissible because it is a temporary change that does not permanently alter the body and is often done for cleanliness or aesthetic reasons. The scholars cite the hadith that permits the use of henna for beautification, stating that it does not constitute changing Allah's creation.

The prohibition is based on hadiths that forbid drawing the Prophet to safeguard his unique status. For example, early Islamic scholars cited the saying, \"Whoever makes a picture of a living being will be punished on the Day of Judgment\" (Sahih Bukhari). Therefore, while the Bible may have illustrations of earlier figures, Islam refrains from visual representation of the Prophet, focusing instead on textual reverence.

The remaining shares are distributed among children, parents, and sometimes siblings, following the hierarchy outlined in Surah An-Nisa.

After the Prophet's death, the companions compiled the Qur'an into a single written codex under Caliph Abu Bakr and later standardized it under Caliph Uthman. The written text was distributed to all major Islamic centers, while the oral tradition continued uninterrupted. For example, the famous Hafs and Warsh recitations are based on chains of transmission that trace back to the Prophet.

A well‑known hadith recorded in Sahih Bukhari states, \"Whoever insults a Prophet, kill him.\" This indicates that, in classical Islamic law, the crime carries a capital penalty. However, the implementation of this punishment depends on the authority of an Islamic state; the Qur'an also emphasizes that judgment belongs to Allah (Surah Al-An'am 6:164).

For example, during the early Muslim community, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) defended the Kaaba from attack, illustrating that jihad is permitted to protect holy places.

When a person spends much of his time posting, commenting, or seeking approval online, his intention may shift from pleasing Allah to gaining worldly fame. This reduces the sincerity of his deeds, making them lighter on the divine scale. The Qur'an warns against being preoccupied with the fleeting world (Surah Al‑Hashr 59:18). Therefore, Muslims are urged to monitor their online activity, ensure their actions are for Allah’s sake, and balance digital engagement with real‑world charitable and spiritual practices.",

The sun is described as a sign of Allah’s creation, not an object of worship. For example, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said, “The sun is a sign of Allah’s power; it is not a deity.” Therefore, any act of sun worship is considered shirk and is forbidden.",

Historically, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) ordered the removal of idols from the Ka‘bah, and the early Muslim community cleared pagan shrines in Arabia. For example, when the Prophet entered Mecca, he ordered the destruction of the three major idols, demonstrating that eliminating symbols of shirk is allowed to restore monotheistic worship.",

Another verse, Surah 41:37, states, “And of His signs are the night and day and the sun and moon.

A mutual fund that pools money from many investors and places it in permissible enterprises is similar to a partnership (shirkah) and is therefore allowed.

The Qur'an condemns unjust gain from uncertainty (Qur'an 2:188) and the Prophet (peace be upon him) warned against selling what is uncertain. Conventional insurance often involves interest‑bearing investments and uncertain payouts, which make it problematic. However, a cooperative model known as takaful, where participants share risk without interest and the surplus is distributed among them, meets Islamic criteria. For example, a group of people contribute a fixed amount each month to cover each other's loss; the surplus, if any, is returned to the participants.

A conversion made under pressure or for worldly benefit does not fulfill the requirement of genuine belief.

The Qur'an commands believers to act according to the Qur'an and authentic Sunnah, and to avoid doubtful matters (Qur'an 5:3).

Historical evidence shows that the date was selected to Christianize popular winter solstice celebrations, not because it was the actual birth date of Christ. This is confirmed by scholarly works such as the 1911 Catholic Encyclopedia and the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1946 edition), which both state that early Christianity did not observe a December 25 birth and that the date was later adopted for cultural assimilation.",

A believer who fulfills these conditions, repents for shortcomings, and consistently seeks Allah’s forgiveness is promised entry into Jannah. For example, a person who regularly prays, gives charity, and repents after a mistake is described in the Qur'an as \"those who have believed and done righteous deeds—those are the best of creation\" (Qur'an 98:7).",

The consistency of the Qur'anic text across all manuscripts, from the early Cairo and Samarkand codices to modern printed editions, shows no substantive differences. For example, the Basmala (the opening phrase \"Bismillahir Rahmanir Raheem\") appears in the same form in all copies, demonstrating uniformity.

The definition is that a qualified scholar, after examining the relevant Quranic verses, prophetic traditions (hadith), and established jurisprudence, gives a response that guides the questioner on what is permissible (halal) or prohibited (haram). For example, when the Pharaoh of Egypt asked his officials to interpret his dream, the Prophet Yusuf (Joseph) provided a divine explanation, which is an early illustration of giving a religious answer to a query.

    "output": "True repentance (tawbah) requires three conditions: sincere remorse for the sin, immediate cessation of the sinful act, and a firm intention not to return to it. The Qur'an states, \"And those who, when they commit an immorality or wrong, remember Allah and seek forgiveness for their sins\" (3:135). The Prophet (peace be upon him) added that repentance must be accompanied by making amends if the sin involved the rights of others. For example, if a person stole, true repentance includes returning the stolen property or compensating the victim. Allah promises to accept sincere repentance: \"Say, ‘O My servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of Allah’s mercy. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins’\" (39:53). This shows that when a person genuinely regrets, stops the sin, and resolves not to repeat it, Allah’s mercy can erase the sin.",

In Islam, the proper way to remember oneself is through reflection on the signs (āyāt) of Allah in the universe and in one’s own heart, not by using images of created beings. The Qur'an says, “And He created you in stages?” (Surah Al‑Mulk 67:3), urging believers to contemplate creation rather than imitate it. A hadith narrated by Abu Hurairah states, “Whoever makes an image of a living being will be punished on the Day of Resurrection.” This hadith warns against creating or venerating images, not against merely looking at them. Therefore, using a donkey’s picture does not amount to shirk (associating partners with Allah), but it also does not fulfill the spiritual goal of self‑remembrance.

The story of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) illustrates this principle: he smashed the idols of his people, declaring that they could not help or harm anyone (Qur'an 21:51‑52).

And he said, ‘Your Lord did not forbid you this tree except that you become angels or become of the immortal.’” (Surah Al‑A‘raaf 7:20‑22). After realizing the error, Adam repented, and Allah forgave him: “Then Adam received from his Lord [some] words, and He turned to him in forgiveness.” (Surah Al‑Baqarah 2:37).

This metaphorical understanding preserves the principle of tanzīh (the incomparability of Allah) while allowing believers to grasp His attributes.

This means that the means of sustenance exist, but they are distributed according to the natural order and the choices of the creatures. When animals or people die of hunger, it is often a result of the ecological balance, human mismanagement, or a test for the individuals involved.

The majority of early manuscripts, including those preserved in the libraries of Damascus, Cairo, and Istanbul, match the text that has been transmitted through the chain of memorization (hifz) and written copies. The consensus among Muslim scholars is that the Quran has been preserved without alteration in its essential content. For example, the famous Sana'a manuscript, despite its palimpsest, confirms the stability of the core text.

The scholar explained that the concept of jihad is often misunderstood; it includes both the internal struggle for self‑purification and the external defense of the community when it is under attack. For example, the early Muslims defended Medina against aggressors, which was a defensive jihad, not an offensive campaign.

Descriptions that the Throne is made of light are found in some hadith literature, but the exact wording varies and scholars differ on the authenticity of those reports.

Therefore, using a machine as a metaphor can help illustrate His omnipresence, but it must be understood that Allah is not a component of the universe.

    "input": "",
    "output": "In John 14:16‑17 the term “Comforter” (Greek: Parakletos) is used. Muslim scholars interpret this as a reference to the Qur'an and the final messenger, Muhammad, who would bring the ultimate guidance after Jesus. The Qur'an itself says in Surah Al‑Maidah (5:46) that Jesus was sent with “the revelation (Injil) and a spirit from Allah.” The “spirit” is understood to be the divine message that would later be completed in the Qur'an. Therefore, the Comforter is not a separate divine entity but a promise of continued guidance, fulfilled by the Qur'an and the Prophet Muhammad, ensuring that the message of monotheism remains unbroken.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Islam holds that ultimate knowledge about the purpose of existence, the unseen (ghayb), and the criteria for judgment belongs solely to Allah. The Qur'an states in Surah Al‑Ankabut (29:56), “And I did not create the jinn and mankind except to worship Me.” Knowledge that leads to worship must therefore come from the Creator. While reason is a valuable tool, it is limited, as illustrated by the earlier supercomputer analogy. Revelation (the Qur'an) provides the definitive answers that human intellect cannot deduce on its own, such as the reality of the afterlife, the nature of divine justice, and the specifics of worship. Hence, Muslims are encouraged to use reason within the framework of revelation, ensuring that conclusions align with divine guidance.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Investing in the stock market is permissible provided the following conditions are met: the company’s business must be halal (e.g., technology, manufacturing) and its earnings must come from permissible sources; the investor must not engage in speculative day‑trading that resembles gambling; and the transaction must be a genuine sale with ownership transferred to the buyer. The Qur’an warns against gambling and excessive uncertainty: “O you who have believed, do not consume usury, doubled and multiplied, but fear Allah that you may be successful” (Qur’an 2:275). Day‑trading, where the trader does not actually own the shares for a meaningful period, is likened to gambling and is therefore discouraged. For example, buying shares of a tech company like Apple, holding them for a reasonable time, and earning dividends from its lawful profits is allowed, whereas repeatedly buying and selling a stock within minutes to chase price fluctuations is not.",

    "input": "",
    "output": "Most scholars consider cryptocurrency not to be a valid currency because it lacks intrinsic value, central regulation, and widespread acceptance as a medium of exchange. It is often treated like a speculative asset, and many compare it to gambling, which is prohibited: “O you who have believed, do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse, and do not kill yourselves” (Qur’an 4:29) – the principle extends to any activity that involves undue risk and chance. Consequently, investing in cryptocurrency is generally deemed impermissible (haram) unless a future consensus among qualified scholars declares it halal. Even if some view it as a currency, the high volatility and the possibility of fraud make it akin to gambling, which the Prophet ﷺ said is “the mother of all evils.”",
